need to know SMILES for exam(basics)

- indices: walk over molecule and get smiles
-> custom ID: every molecule already has indices in rdkit 
assign new indices 
no chirality no stereochemistry
- DFS on molelcular graph (atoms and bonds) not more
- 1 to m create own indices
visited as visited make list -> go direction of the lower indices
smiles no unique
IDs for
